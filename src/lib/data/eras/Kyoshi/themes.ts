    name: 'Justice and Revenge',
    text: `With so many wrongs committed without anyone in power 
    willing to bring the criminals to justice, people may find they 
    need to seek out justice—or revenge—on their own. In many 
    instances, the guilty party is one of the individuals in power. 
    When people cannot avenge or rescue their loved ones themselves, they look to others to do the job on their behalf, even if 
    those others are outlaws. `,
    gm_moves: [
      `Call revenge justice and vice versa`,
      `Put allies on the side of revenge, or enemies on the side of justice`,

    name: 'Betrayal and Loyalty',
    text: `Sometimes the people you trust the most end up hurting you 
    the worst. A student might learn that their bending teacher has 
    kept a terrible secret from them, or a character’s new daofei
    family might insist upon a show of loyalty that involves harming 
    a former ally. Enemies become teammates, and friends become 
    new enemies. While selfishness is sometimes to blame for these 
    shifting alliances, the desire to survive is often the root problem. 
    That makes true friendships hard to come by in this era, and 
    well worth fighting for.`,
    gm_moves: [
      `Test "unbreakable" bonds`,
      `Reveal shocking betrayals`,
      `Turn former enemies into allies and vice versa`

    name: 'Abuse of Authority',
    text: `Government and criminal leaders alike abuse their influence 
    over others in this era. While some leaders are incompetent, 
    others are actively cruel and self-serving. Individuals who hold 
    less power are seen as expendable pieces in these crooked bigshots’ games, and those who aren’t careful can become pawns 
    without even realizing it.`,
    gm_moves: [
      `Reveal a blatant or hidden abuse of an authority's power`,
      `Represent a system that defends incompetent leaders`,
      `Manipulate, bribe, or threaten "pawns" into uncomfortable action`

    name: 'Loss and Abandonment',
    text: `Many Earth Kingdom children were orphaned because of the 
    Yellow Neck Uprising; an entire generation of young adults have 
    only themselves to rely on. They were juggled between guardians and kicked out into the street, and many were forgotten. 
    Now these people must learn to trust again. Those who had 
    a very difficult time growing up or were betrayed by someone 
    they trusted may have sworn to never rely on others ever again.`,

      `Lash out against an offer of kindness`,
      `Provide opportunities for people to earn a reciprocate trust`

    name: 'Law and Order',
    text: `Conflicts within and between daofei groups, as well as between 
    criminals and law enforcement, are widespread at this time. 
    Not all outlaws are the same, and for many having a family of 
    criminals is a better alternative to fending for themselves on 
    the streets. While some daofei, like the Yellow Necks, have lofty 
    goals of overthrowing the Earth Kingdom’s government, other 
    outlaws just want to survive and look out for their own, like the 
    Southern Water Tribe pirates. Meanwhile, local law enforcement often doesn’t know how to handle the rampant criminal 
    behavior. In some cases, powerful criminals pay them to look 
    the other way. With many people forced to extremes just to 
    survive, a life of crime is an appealing option.`,
    gm_moves: [
      `Provide justifiable reasons for a life of crime`,
      `Display the familial structure of criminal organizations`,
      `Erupt into open conflict between law and order on the street`

    name: 'Harmony Without, Turmoil Within',
    text: `Appearances are everything to many governments, organizations, 
    and even families. Some groups go through more trouble to 
    appear to have everything under control than they do to actually 
    get things under control. Fire Nation clans who feel their influence wane with the subtle shifts in power might fight to keep up 
    appearances so that their rivals don’t think they’ve grown weak. 
    Air Temples may seem tranquil to guests while Airbenders argue 
    behind closed doors about the direction of their people.`,

      `Present superficial positivity masking deeper problems`,
      `Demand conflicts be pushed into the shadows`,
