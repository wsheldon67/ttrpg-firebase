    text: `Inflict a fatigue or condition`,
    tags: ['Basic'],
    cat: 'Basic',
    context: `When the companions do something taxing or get hurt in some 
    way, this is the easiest move to use: just assign some fatigue or 
    a condition. The fiction around this move can vary a lot, but 
    always remember to put the fiction first by describing the situation—“You tumble off the boat into the cold water”—before you 
    start telling players to mark fatigue or conditions. You’ve got to 
    create a compelling world, and that means making sure that each 
    fatigue or condition marked is tied back to the fiction.`
  },{
    text: `Reveal a hidden truth`,
    tags: ['Basic'],
    cat: 'Basic',
    context: `Want to add drama to a scene? Reveal new information! While this 
    can be a truth about a scheme or plot you’ve had in mind for a while, 
    you can also create a new, explosive truth on the spot. You didn’t 
    have to know that a PC’s masked foe was secretly their mother in 
    disguise before you reveal it! Fill in mysteries with a rewarding and 
    dramatic answer for the moment; you don’t have to commit in advance to an answer that ends up making little sense in the moment.`
  },{
    text: `Shift their balance`,
    tags: ['Basic'],
    cat: 'Basic',
    context: `Sometimes the companions might do things that lead you to 
    shift their balance directly—a hard move! But usually NPCs 
    attempt to shift a PC’s balance when they interact with the PCs. Because balance is so internal (and often personal to players), a 
    good technique is to ask the players what they think: “This seems to 
    me like you’re moving towards Tradition…what do you think?” `
  },{
    text: `Twist loyalties with tempting offers`,
    tags: ['Basic'],
    cat: 'Basic',
    context: `The companions often think they know who’s good and who’s 
    bad. This move complicates that belief. Give the companions 
    reasons to side with enemies and reasons to doubt their allies. 
    Maybe their allies use shady means to achieve their goals and 
    ask the PCs to participate? Maybe their enemies want the same 
    thing as the companions (for now…) and ask for their help? Either way, remind them that nothing is simple in the Avatarverse!`
  },{
    text: `Escalate to violence`,
    tags: ['Basic'],
    cat: 'Basic',
    context: `Consider carefully when to make NPCs resort to violence; while 
    potent (and often exciting), this is an easy move to overuse. Does an 
    NPC’s balance principle suggest it or did they just tip over on their 
    balance track? Have the companions committed some grave act or 
    offered a heinous insult? Does it add to the story’s drama for a fight 
    to occur right now? Make violence mean something.`
  },{
    text: `Offer a risky or costly opportunity`,
    tags: ['Basic'],
    cat: 'Basic',
    context: `When the companions are stuck on how to move forward, offer 
    them risky or costly opportunities to get what they want. Show 
    them a path to reach their goals (maybe through an NPC’s offer 
    or through a flash of insight), but make it a dangerous path. The 
    idea isn’t to demand PCs take that path—they might not choose 
    if the path is too dangerous or isn’t worth it to them! But any 
    such offer always pushes the conversation forward productively, 
    even if the players turn down the offer.`
  },{
    text: `Threaten someone`,
    tags: ['Basic'],
    cat: 'Basic',
    context: `You can always make a move to put someone in a terrible 
    position—a situation in which they have to react immediately 
    or face some harm. It’s easy to do this for PCs; when they get 
    spotted by the guards, you’ve threatened that PC. But you can 
    threaten NPCs as well, putting them into spots that demand action from the PCs. Every playbook pushes players to create some 
    NPCs they care about. Put those loved ones in danger to raise 
    the stakes and the tension. Maybe they get captured, thrown in 
    front of an attack, or even threatened with emotional pain (like 
    breakups, family feuds, or utter despair). Similarly, threatening 
    innocent bystanders is a great way to push heroic PCs to action.`
  },{
    text: `Shift the odds, suddenly`,
    tags: ['Basic'],
    cat: 'Basic',
    context: `When the action becomes predictable, twist the situation into 
    something surprising and new. Whoever was losing might find a 
    sudden, powerful advantage! An unseen trap might be sprung! An 
    important NPC might appear and change everything! When you 
    shift the odds in such a way, emphasize circumstances outside the 
    companions’ control. This move represents traps, ambushes, and surprising 
    new events.`
  },{
    text: `Exploit a weakness in their history`,
    tags: ['Basic'],
    cat: 'Basic',
    context: `A PC’s backstory is fertile ground in which to find story seeds. This move covers everything from having an existing NPC 
    recognize a PC from the same background, to introducing one 
    of the PC’s mentors, to playing up an old rivalry—just so long as 
    it complicates their story now. This move also covers emphasizing the limits of skill and knowledge the PCs might 
    have garnered from their history.`
  },{
    text: `Provide wisdom in unlikely places`,
    tags: ['Basic'],
    cat: 'Basic',
    context: `Wisdom in the Avatarverse comes in many forms, from many 
    places. If the companions are debating what course of action to take, a fishmonger 
    who overhears them might offer some clarity based on his “humble 
    experience.” When the companions are agonizing about a moral 
    decision, a child might articulate the consequences of each choice. If you don’t periodically make a move to offer PCs a chance 
    to learn techniques or garner wisdom from those around them, 
    they likely won’t learn to seek it out. Surprise the companions 
    with a bit of hidden wisdom from time to time…and masters 
    who might teach them new techniques and abilities.`
  },{
    text: `Turn a move back on them`,
    tags: ['Basic'],
    cat: 'Basic',
    context: `When players roll a miss, a great way of creating interesting 
    consequences is to imagine what could happen if the same move 
    succeeded against them. Feel free to make this a harder move (for 
    example, when the PCs fail at intimidating an NPC, they’re forced 
    to flee in terror instead) or a softer move, where you offer them 
    the chance to resist the consequence in exchange for fatigue, a 
    condition, or the like.`
